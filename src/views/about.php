                    Lazar Minkov was born in Sofia, Bulgaria. He moved to Germany when he was 12. In 2022 and eight
                    schools later, he graduated a “Commercial School of Freising” in 2022. He moved in Summer 2022 to
                    Bern, Switzerland. He started with his education in SAE Institute Zurich as Web design &
                    Development. Apex Motorsport is the Project he created for his study.

                    He was so passionate about cars and motorsport, but till now he was searching for a way to show his
                    knowledge and passion to the world. His Idea was to influence others to learn more about sports cars
                    and their functionalities. From early he showed interest in loud and sporty cars. He built up
                    knowledge for cars, by reading reviews taking a part in car communities, learning about specific
                    models. He would dream of driving sports-car and building own “Project Car” as every one who has
                    interest in car would.

                    to provide information and knowledge about sports cars. And build a strong car enthusiast community,
                    after publishing the Website. Lazar is planing to include a page for motorcycles in the future.
                    Showing the different types of motorcycles and how to choose a suitable motorcycle for your need.
